This program reads from a file named stocks.txt
displays a menu and prompts for input fromt he user
based on the users menu choice it prompts for either a stock ticker or price
program then displays proper information based on users input
program exits properly


I did have one issue while using netbeans to write this program.
The switch statement was being ignored originally even though the statememnt itself didnt change from what it was now.
Problem was solved by deleting the project and associated files then recreating the project and pasting the code back into it at which point it executed properly.
